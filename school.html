    <h1>Main School</h1>
    <p>
        The Main School campus ambience and the art décor speak volumes about the school philosophy which inspires critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, teamwork, citizenship and leadership.

        The highly welcoming and impressive school reception, the colourful classrooms with striking soft boards and the creatively painted corridors go a long way in fostering innovation, excellence and design thinking which are essential skills for the 21st century learner.
