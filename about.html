    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Anand Niketan Mehsana</b> was founded in 2009, under the aegis of Sarjan Foundation, to create a place where all <br>
        individuals can develop their individuality in a socially acceptable manner, for the benefit of the society.<br>
        The aim was and will always be that quality education should be available at all levels and for all.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the foundational belief that students are like seeds, we make all efforts to nurture students with <i><b>joy</i></b>,<br>
        instilling <i><b>proficiency</i></b> in them through learning <i><b>activities</i></b>, thus honing their <i><b>skills</i></b> and helping them grow into a complete tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        
    We, at <b>Anand Niketan Mehsana</b>, strongly advocate the creation of an environment where joy of work and co-operation are the key motivating<br>
    factors and where the role of adults, as teachers or as parents, is to nurture the inherent values and qualities present in each child,<br>
    rather than suppress them in the name of education or development.
